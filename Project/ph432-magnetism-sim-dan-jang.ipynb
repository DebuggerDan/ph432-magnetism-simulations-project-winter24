    "## **Abstract**\n",
    "Based on concepts explored in *PH 431: Electricity & Magnetism I* and from our textbook, *Introduction to Electrodynamics* by David J. Griffiths [[1]](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/introduction-to-electrodynamics/3AB220820DBB628E5A43D52C4B011ED4#overview), we created a computational physics project based on *Python* for exploring the simulation of various electrodynamics phenomena, particularly in the modeling and visualization of *electric fields*, *potentials*, and *point charges*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our exploration project was primarily based on a deconstructed, piece-by-piece implementation of these electrodynamics' topics in electromagnetism, where a *Python*-based, *Project Jupyter Notebook* [[2]](https://jupyter.org) was used to highlight particular parts & pieces of our project, with specific examples of electromagnetic phenomena and situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project primarily features the *PyCharge* [[3]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12437) and *PyGame* [[4]](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about) libraries – as well as the implementation of other libraries and visual or mathematical methods of computational physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of our project was to help provide an elementary, or otherwise easy-to-under introduction to electromagnetism, particularly on the 3D representation of electric fields & potentials and moving point charges in those fields and potentials."
